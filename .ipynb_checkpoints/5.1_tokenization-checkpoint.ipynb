       " \"I shall be late!'\",\n",
       " '(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.',\n",
       " 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.',\n",
       " 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.',\n",
       " 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next.',\n",
       " 'First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.',\n",
       " \"She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\",\n",

       " \"There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'\",\n",
       " 'She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.',\n",
       " 'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.',\n",
       " \"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!\",\n",
       " 'either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.',\n",
       " 'However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!',\n",
       " 'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.',\n",
       " \"How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders.\",\n",
       " 'Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!',\n",
       " \"I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'\",\n",
       " 'For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.',\n",
       " \"There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.\",\n",
       " \"It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.\",\n",
       " '\\'No, I\\'ll look first,\\' she said, \\'and see whether it\\'s marked \"poison\" or not\\'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \\'poison,\\' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.',\n",
       " \"However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\",\n",

       " 'And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.',\n",
       " \"First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle.\",\n",
       " \"I wonder what I should be like then?'\",\n",
       " 'And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.',\n",
       " 'After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!',\n",
       " 'when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.',\n",
       " \"'Come, there's no use in crying like that!'\",\n",
       " \"said Alice to herself, rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!'\",\n",
       " 'She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.',\n",
       " \"'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\",\n",
       " \"Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\",\n",
       " \"Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\",\n",
       " \"'Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'\",\n",
       " \"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way?\",\n",
       " 'Which way?',\n",
       " \"', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\",\n",
